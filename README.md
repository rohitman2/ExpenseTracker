# ExpenseTracker
Expense tracker with income and expenditure transactions


Wrote a JAVA program to build an expense tracker where users can:
- Add income and expenses
- Categorize their transactions (e.g., Food, Rent, Travel)
- View monthly summaries
- Save/load data from a file

Instructions : 

- When we run your program It should take income/expense as an input
- Once we choose income/expense it should ask for the sub category like salary/business for income or food/rent/travel for expense
- Once we enter all the details you should store it somewhere and provide us a monthly summary
- Also your Java program should take a file as an input where the file may contain multiple income/expense categories entries (you can define the structure of the entries and file)
